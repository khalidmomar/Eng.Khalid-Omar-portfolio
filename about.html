    <section id="about">
        <p>My journey in engineering and technology began with a passion for mechanical systems and a curiosity for how things work. This led me to pursue a BSc in Mechanical Engineering with a focus on Mechatronics and Automation. Over the years, I honed my skills in project management, maintenance engineering, and service engineering, working across various industries including IoT, logistics, and pharmaceuticals.</p>
        <p>Driven by a desire to stay ahead of the curve, I pursued an MSc in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, where I deepened my understanding of data science and analytics. This advanced knowledge has enabled me to apply AI-driven solutions to real-world challenges, optimizing processes and improving decision-making across organizations.</p>
        <p>I believe in the power of technology to transform businesses, and I am committed to helping organizations harness this potential to achieve their strategic goals. Whether it's through innovative IoT solutions, data-driven insights, or streamlined operations, my goal is to deliver tangible results that make a difference.</p>
